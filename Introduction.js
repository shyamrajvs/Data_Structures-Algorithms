//Getting into data structures and algorithms with JavaScript is a fantastic way to enhance your coding skills.

//start with the basics and gradually move on to more complex topics.

/*Hereâ€™s a rough outline to get you started:

1. Basic Data Structures

    Arrays

        Operations: push, pop, shift, unshift, slice, splice

        Methods: map, filter, reduce

    Objects

        Key-value pairs

        Iteration: for...in, Object.keys(), Object.values()
        
2. Advanced Data Structures

    Linked Lists

        Singly linked lists

        Doubly linked lists

    Stacks and Queues

        Stack operations: push, pop

        Queue operations: enqueue, dequeue

    Hash Tables

        Implementation using objects

        Collision resolution strategies

3. Algorithms

    Sorting Algorithms

        Bubble Sort

        Selection Sort

        Insertion Sort

        Merge Sort

        Quick Sort

Searching Algorithms

    Linear Search

    Binary Search

4. Complexity Analysis

    Big O Notation

        Understanding time and space complexity

        Analyzing algorithms

5. Trees and Graphs

    Binary Trees

        Traversal methods: in-order, pre-order, post-order
    Graphs

        Representation: adjacency matrix, adjacency list

        Traversal algorithms: BFS, DFS

6. Practice Problems

    LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal for practice problems and challenges. */
